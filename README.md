This project focuses on analyzing employee attrition and predicting turnover to help HR teams take proactive measures. Using Acme Corporation’s five-year employee dataset—including demographics, job satisfaction, performance metrics, and turnover history—data was cleaned and visualized in BI dashboards to reveal key patterns such as high-risk departments and factors driving attrition. A machine learning model was built to predict employees likely to leave, updated in real time with new HR data and integrated into the dashboards for live monitoring. This enables HR managers to receive alerts, drill into high-risk teams, and implement targeted retention strategies, improving workforce planning and reducing turnover.
